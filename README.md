<!--### 👋 Hi, I'm a DevOps Engineer passionate about Cloud, Automation, and Scalable Infrastructure.

I build reliable, scalable systems using tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Kubernetes**, **AWS**, **GitHub Actions**, and **ArgoCD**. I believe in automation as a force multiplier and love turning manual processes into repeatable, testable code.

🛠️ I’ve:
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines (cut deployment time by 40%)
- Automated AWS infrastructure with 100% environment parity
- Built observability stacks with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK
- Rolled out secure, resilient Kubernetes environments with Helm
- Embedded DevSecOps practices using Trivy & SonarQube

📌 Always learning, always building — from scripts to scalable systems.

🔭 Currently focusing on Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, and Cloud-native observability.
